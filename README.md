# Web Speech

## Description

How to build a voice-enabled web application using Node.js and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
The objective of this project is to create a bot that interacts with users through a web interface, converts voice input into text, processes it using GPT, converts the GPT response back into spoken word, and presents the audio response to the user.

By enabling users to communicate with GPT using their voice, we can create a more interactive and natural user experience.
